# Django BASIN-3D Releases

## 0.1.0 (Alpha)
First alpha release of django-basin3d. Includes modernization of build system to publish to pypi.

django-basin3d requires basin3d, which performs core synthesis functionality. django-basin3d is the web framework portion of the original BASIN-3D codebase. We separated the web framework from the core synthesis functionality for improved maintenance and extensibility.
